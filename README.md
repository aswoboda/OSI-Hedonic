OSI-Hedonic
===========

This project seeks to include the Nega et al. (2010) Open Space Index in a hedonic analysis of housing prices.

Project Folder Structure:
This Github repository is named "OSI-Hedonic" and everything in it should be the same for all members of the research team because we are using the Git version control system.

Each team member should have the "OSI-Hedonic" folder inside a folder named "OSI Hedonic Project" (naming it exactly that might be helpful in the future). 

Inside the "OSI Hedonic Project" folder, each user should create a "Data" folder which each researcher is responsible for keeping up-to-date with the most recent data files coming from ArcMAp and the GIS drive. Please keep the most recent data file titled "DataFromARCMAP.dbf." 
* We need to settle on a naming convention for older data.
* We need to write-up instructions for how to access the most up-to-date data file on the GIS volume and then move the file to the R Server

Repository File Structure:
Inside the "OSI-Hedonic" Repository and folder you should see the following items:
* .gitignore file (you can ignore this!)
* "figures" folder (we will store the figures we create here)
* "README.md" file (the file you are reading right now)
* "sandbox" folder (each of us has a space in this folder in which we can play around with experimental code or output)
* "writeup" folder (we will store our written documents here)
                   -
